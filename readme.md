(So far this is just a small note for myself.)

* I have a note in the Notes app called "KenKen methods of deduction and ideas"
  which is currently the central place for my thoughts on this repo.

- [ ] Saving to something with .kk doesn't add a new .kk extension.
- [ ] Be able to resize the terminal.
- [ ] Make it visually more globally obvious when we're in clue-editing mode.

- [x] In clue-editing: hjkl goes to the next clueless group in that dir.
- [x] In clue-editing: n goes to the next clueless group in reading order.
- [x] If someone executes ":w" alone, it saves to the current filename.
- [ ] Print out the time it took to solve a puzzle.
